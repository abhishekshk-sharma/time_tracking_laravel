Route to trigger notification from browser:

Add to routes/web.php:

Route::post('/trigger-lunch-notification', function(Request $request) {
    return response()->json([
        'success' => true,
        'message' => 'Lunch break ends in 5 minutes!',
        'title' => '🍽️ Lunch Break Reminder',
        'body' => 'Your lunch break ends soon. Please return to work.',
        'trigger' => true
    ]);
})->middleware('auth')->name('trigger.lunch.notification');

Then the service worker will show the notification when this endpoint is called.

The issue is: Web Push from server requires proper FCM Server Key (not VAPID key).
The test-push page works because it's client-side only.

SOLUTION: Get your FCM Server Key from Firebase Console and update FCM_SERVER_KEY in .env
